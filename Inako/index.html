    <div class="container">

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>
            Inako Business Consultants was founded by Andiswa Anelisa Dumse in 2013, drawing on her
            extensive background in accounting and finance to support Small, Medium and Micro
            Enterprises (SMMEs) in achieving sustainable growth and long-term prosperity. Through
            close engagement with entrepreneurs across various sectors, she identified recurring
            challenges related to compliance, operational efficiency, and access to reliable
            support systems — challenges that continue to limit the growth potential of many
            businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Established to bridge these gaps, Inako has grown into a trusted partner for SMMEs,
            offering practical, results-driven solutions that strengthen governance, improve
            financial performance, and enable informed decision-making. Our approach is rooted in
            understanding the realities of doing business in South Africa and responding with
            solutions that are both strategic and implementable.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3>Our New Chapter</h3>

        <p>
            After more than a decade of guiding SMMEs toward success, Inako Business Consultants has
            entered a new phase of growth. Building on our strong foundation in business consulting,
            we have expanded our footprint to deliver value across additional industries that play
            a critical role in economic development and infrastructure growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our expanded service offering now includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Construction, Engineering and Mining support services</li>
            <li>General supply and delivery solutions for business and project needs</li>
            <li>SHEQ management services focused on safety, health, environmental and quality compliance</li>
            <li>Supply of reinforcing steel, structural steel and related steel products for construction,
                petrochemical, gas and mining industries</li>
            <li>Clear Vu and palisade fencing supply and installation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This expansion enables us to provide integrated solutions that support operational
            execution alongside strategic planning. By broadening our scope, we are better
            positioned to drive economic growth, create employment opportunities, improve lives,
            and contribute meaningfully to the development of resilient industries and communities.
